 Pixels representing height. Range: 0-1 
 
 18: int triangleCount = (tex->width-1) * (tex->height-1) * 2;

 We extended it to support free movement in the XZ plane, instead of just rotation/zoom around the Y axis.

 The approximation (number 2), calculating the cross product.

 We use the x and z position of the object to index in the vertex array. This way we find what polygon we are currently directly above. Then we calculate the plane 
 equation of this polygon using cross product -> normal -> normal form and then use this equation to calculate the desired y value for the object.

 We passed the position to the fragment shader and checked if y < 0.1. In that case, output blue instead of something actually useful.
