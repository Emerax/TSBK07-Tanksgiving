You can see differences in colors along the axes. It will always be partly blue since we passed on no color to the z value.

	out_Color = vec4(texCoord, 1.0, 1.0);

We multiplied the coordinate vector by sin(t), where t dependes on the time.

Vet ej? LÃ¥ta CPUn pre-processa texturen?

The CPU cannot pass the texture to the shaders, it needs to be loaded in the GPU

Translate the model by -3 along the z axis

Possibly for v = (0, 0, 0)

Fragment shader. Diffuse shading...?

Position, for instance, needs the fourth dimension (in order to be able to perform translation using multiplication).

Rotating an object is done by transforming the model matrix of each given object.
Rotating the camera is done by transforming the camera matrix, which is turn transforms each model in the scene.
